# Pong
A modified game of pong made in C++ with SDL2.

To download the executable file, go to [releases](https://github.com/vkeshav300/pong-game/releases).
This was made off a tutorial, then added onto by me. [Click Me](https://github.com/jarreed0/retroremake) to see the original repository.

**Side Note:**
Please note that the collisions and general gameplay is glitchy. This is my first full C++ Game, and I am still learning.
